<p>What is a static page? You are viewing one right now! They are page content that can be edited via the back-end area, when selecting the menu item called <em>Pages</em>.</p>

<p>All Static Pages provided by the <strong>RainLab.Pages</strong> plugin can be translated by default.</p>

<p>Once you have selected the page you want to edit, click the language picker next to the field you want to translate. It couldn't get any simpler than this!</p>
