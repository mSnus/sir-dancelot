# Musicality: visual representation of music


## Basics

### Musicality
- Contrast and accent

Imagine counting power line poles along the railroad as they flash one by one behind the train window.
If they are all painted black, you'll immediately notice one painted in red-white stripes. If one is absent, you'll notice its absence. If one is thicker or higher than the others, you'll notice this.
That is the **contrast** that creates an **accent**. Black to white, presence to absence, change of shape or size - every that attracts attention by standing out of the sequence.

Musical accents are the same. Simplier are sound/silence, raise and drop of volume level or tone, switch to solo and many more. More sophisticated accents come from change of saturation or dynamics, changing the paterns and mood, and so on.

- Dancing contrasts and musicality

In dance, musicaility is an attempt to make a visual representation of the music. This is achieved by:
- creating visual contrasts in dance that are exactly time-aligned with musical contrasts
- following [musical structures](#rhytm)
- following the global [music flow](#understanding-global-music-flow)

### Rhytm
- Hits and pauses
- Dots and dashes
- Speed and acceleration
 

### Understanding global music flow
- origins and original styling
- mood and emotional context
- speed (and why it's not only about BPMs)
- base rhytm
- musical structure (squares, verse, refrains, bridges)
- real (resulting) rhytm

## Moves
### Rythmical
- steps
    - why not to stick to single basic step
- changing shape
- look direction
- tense and relax muscles   

### Sharp, angled and rigid 
- breaks
- freeze
- pulse/patterns

### Smooth, curvy and fading 
- waves
- circles
- eights

### Using body
- legs
    - weight transfer
    - feet, heels and toes
    - whole legs
    - knees
    - spring and straighten
    - jumps, checks, steps
    - kick, cut, rondo
    - rotating in hip joint
    - swivel

- hands

- continuing from one part to another

## Dancing in couples

- lead and follow
- distance
- inertia
- questions and answers
- initiative transfer: when and how to

## What do vary
- distance
- direction
- line to circle
- moving co- and counter-directionally
- rhytm
- dynamics
- height levels
- detail level
